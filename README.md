# FIT9136 Python Assignments (Assignment 1 – 3)

This repository contains my solutions for Assignment 1 through Assignment 3 in FIT9136 (Introduction to Python Programming). The code is organized by assignment, and each file corresponds to exercises covering the weekly topics listed below. Feel free to browse the code, run the scripts, and adapt them for your learning.

## Repository Overview

This repo holds my Python solutions for the first three assignments of FIT9136. Each assignment builds on the concepts introduced each week, from basic syntax to unit testing and recursion. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of:

- Core Python syntax and structures  
- Control flow (conditionals & loops)  
- Working with data structures (lists, dictionaries, strings)  
- File input/output  
- Organizing code into functions and modules  
- Object-oriented design  
- Error handling and testing  
- Recursive techniques

## Week-by-Week Topics

Below is a summary of the topics covered in the FIT9136 unit. The assignments draw upon these concepts in sequence.

- **Week 1: Introduction to Python, Variables, Statements**  
  - Python interpreter basics  
  - Variables, data types, assignment  
  - Simple input/output and arithmetic operations  

- **Week 2: Conditionals and Iteration (while loops)**  
  - `if` / `elif` / `else`  
  - Boolean logic and comparison operators  
  - `while` loops for repeated execution  

- **Week 3: Iteration (for loops) and Sequences**  
  - `for` loops over lists, tuples, strings  
  - Sequence operations (indexing, slicing)  
  - Common built-in functions for sequences  

- **Week 4: Functions, Scoping, Namespaces and Dictionaries**  
  - Defining and calling functions  
  - Parameter passing and return values  
  - Local vs. global scope; namespaces  
  - Dictionary creation and common methods  

- **Week 5: Transforming Sequences (Mutability & Memory)**  
  - Mutable vs. immutable types  
  - List methods (`append`, `pop`, `insert`, etc.)  
  - Aliasing, shallow vs. deep copies  

- **Week 6: File IO**  
  - Reading from and writing to text files  
  - Using `open()` in various modes (`r`, `w`, `a`)  
  - Context managers (`with` statement)  

- **Week 7: Modules and Libraries**  
  - Importing standard library modules (e.g., `math`, `random`)  
  - Organizing code into separate modules  
  - Installing and using third-party packages (where applicable)  

- **Week 8: Object-Oriented Programming 1**  
  - Defining classes and objects  
  - Instance attributes vs. class attributes  
  - `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`  

- **Week 9: Object-Oriented Programming 2**  
  - Inheritance, method overriding  
  - Encapsulation and access control conventions (`_protected`, `__private`)  
  - Special (dunder) methods for operator overloading  

- **Week 10: Assertions, Exceptions and Unit Testing**  
  - Writing `assert` statements to check invariants  
  - Raising and catching exceptions (`try` / `except`)  
  - Using Python’s built-in `unittest` framework  

- **Week 11: Recursion**  
  - Defining recursive functions  
  - Base cases and recursive cases  
  - Common recursion examples (factorial, Fibonacci, etc.)
